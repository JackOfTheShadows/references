# Search for work in files
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
    -r or -R is recursive,
    -n is line number, and
    -w stands for match the whole word.
    -l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
#Along with these, --exclude, --include, --exclude-dir flags could be used for efficient searching, example:
	-grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

-B NUM, --before-context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.  Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches.
-C NUM, --context=NUM
